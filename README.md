# Windows MDM Demo In Go Lang
## Status: Working
I was trying to develop an MDM server to manage Windows 10 computers using the built-in protocol Windows Mobile Device Management protocol. I found the documentation really difficult to understand and I could not find any open source demo's on the internet. So I figured out the protocol and am publishing this for anyone who is trying to do the same thing. This codebase is not designed to be production ready, clean and error free code, It is meant to show you the minimum requirements to get a Windows 10 device enrolled under management.

# Licence
This code is MIT licensed so use it in your projects as long as you give credit to me.

# Why did I build this?
This code is going to be cleaned up (a lot) and integrated into [Mattrax](https://github.com/mattrax/Mattrax)!

# The Certificates ("/depot" folder)?
These certificates are generated by [MicroMDM SCEP](https://github.com/micromdm/scep). I am doing this because I am implementing both a Windows MDM and Apple MDM server in my main project [Mattrax](https://github.com/mattrax/Mattrax) and so being able to use the same certificates was something that I was hoping for.
